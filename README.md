Prey Selection
====

Code for running models for Prey Selection Studies.

v103 = experiment 1
v104 = experiment 2
v105 = experiment 3

Each of these folders has the data for the task as well as the computational models.

Model code is in Julia and runs via Jupyter notebook. For these I used Julia V0.7 but they should run on later (>1) releases. 

The model fitting uses EM code which was written by Nathaniel Daw. I include a folder here with his code for convenience (with his permission) but please cite Nathaniel if you appropriate this for other uses.

Plots folder has code for reproducing the figures in the paper - this runs in R notebook. There is also a source data file in here which has the basic numbers (means etc.) for the plots.
